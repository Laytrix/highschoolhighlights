# Highschool
This repository includes the final project for my programming classes from grade 10, 11, and 12.
Most of the resources from these original projects are available in this repository. However some code is lost to time, and many images (mainly from my grade 10 project).

Grade 10 featured mostly HTML and CSS, with some Javascript programming.
The final product was an individual project to create a website to sell computers.

Grade 11 featured Java, with simple concepts throughout the year such as arrays and loops.
The final product was an open-ended project. Two friends and I created a makeshift version of "Tetris" in Processing.

Grade 12 featured C++, with more complex concepts such as pointers, sorting algorithms, and OOP.
The final product was a somewhat open-ended individual project. It needed to be a working airline booking database.
